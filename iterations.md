# Aircraft Battle Game - Iteration Planning

## Overview

The development of the Aircraft Battle Game will be conducted across three iterations, following an incremental approach. Each iteration will focus on delivering a set of functional use cases that build upon the previous iteration's foundation.

## Iteration 1: Core Connection and Game Setup

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Focus:** Establish the foundation for the game by implementing the basic client-server architecture, room creation/joining, and the UI framework.

**Use Cases to Implement:**

1. **UC1: Create Game Room**
   * Implement websocket server handling
   * Create room ID generation
   * Develop initial UI for room creation
   * Design waiting screen for room host
2. **UC2: Join Game Room**
   * Implement room joining functionality
   * Create UI for room code entry
   * Add validation for room existence and capacity
   * Establish player connection handling
3. **Basic UI Framework**
   * Implement screen navigation (menu, waiting, game screens)
   * Design and implement the grid system
   * Create responsive layout for different devices
   * Implement basic styling and theme

**Deliverable:** A functional prototype where players can create rooms, join rooms using room IDs, and see the basic game interface with empty grids.

## Iteration 2: Game Preparation Phase

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Focus:** Implement plane placement mechanics and the ready system to prepare for gameplay.

**Use Cases to Implement:**

1. **UC3: Place Planes**
   * Implement plane selection and visualization
   * Create placement preview functionality
   * Add rotation mechanics (key 'R')
   * Implement placement validation (boundary and overlap checks)
   * Add plane removal functionality
   * Create visual indicators for placed planes
2. **UC4: Ready Status**
   * Implement ready button functionality
   * Create ready state tracking
   * Implement synchronization between players
   * Add game state transition from preparation to battle
   * Design turn assignment mechanism

**Deliverable:** A game where players can create/join rooms, place planes on their grids with visual feedback, and indicate readiness to start the battle.

## Iteration 3: Battle Phase and Game Completion

**Duration:** 3 weeks

**Focus:** Implement the core gameplay mechanics, scoring, and game resolution.

**Use Cases to Implement:**

1. **UC5: Attack Enemy Grid**
   * Implement turn-based attack system
   * Create attack validation
   * Implement hit detection logic
   * Add special handling for head hits
   * Implement visual feedback for attacks
   * Create turn switching mechanism
   * Add game-over detection and winner declaration
2. **UC6: Mark Suspected Planes**
   * Implement cell marking functionality
   * Create toggle mechanism for marks
   * Add visual indicators for marked cells
3. **Additional Features**
   * Implement game statistics tracking
   * Add recent games history
   * Create game reset functionality
   * Add disconnection handling and reconnection
   * Implement proper error handling and user feedback

**Deliverable:** A complete and fully functional Aircraft Battle Game with all core features implemented and polished.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

| Risk                                   | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WebSocket connection instability       | Medium      | High   | Implement robust reconnection mechanism and state preservation |
| Synchronization issues between players | Medium      | High   | Thorough testing of turn management and state updates          |
| Browser compatibility issues           | Medium      | Medium | Cross-browser testing and use of standard Web APIs             |
| UI responsiveness on mobile devices    | Medium      | Medium | Responsive design and testing on various device sizes          |
| Game rule edge cases                   | Low         | Medium | Comprehensive unit testing of game logic                       |
